# My quines

> A [quine] is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

My friend [Malcolm] pointed me at [Ken Thompson]'s 1983 [Turing Award] acceptance speech, [Reflections on trusting trust] which talks about the [inherent insecurity of compiled code].

At the beginning of the lecture Thompson briefly mentions playing with self-reproducing programs during his colleges days:

> [...] write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source. If you have never done this, I urge you to try it on your own. The discovery of how to do it is a revelation that far surpasses any benefit obtained by being told how to do it.

Of course at this point I stopped reading and started coding. This repo is the result.
